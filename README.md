# Discogs to Woocommerce
 A basic plugin that allows the import of a Discogs user's inventory, to WooCommerce as products

 The plugin currently does not use the Discogs auth flow, so importing products is limited to specific product information such as:
 Artist name
 Album name
 Description
 Discogs user comments

 The discogs API requires the use of the Auth flow in order to retrieve product images, this is a goal I am working towards

## Setup
1. Download the files and import as a zip file as you would a normal plugin with Wordpress
2. Load up wordpress and enable the plugin
3. Go to the settings page and input your Discogs username and Discogs API information

## Importing Products
1. Navigate to the Discogs to Woocommerce page in the Wordpress CMS
2. Load the plugin, tick the boxes of products you wish to import and import them!

## Roundup
I have a number of goals I want to achieve with this plugin, so I intend on continuing to update it. In it's current state, it is functional but not very user friendly - please only use if you are familiar with Wordpress plugin development!
